> A complete re-write of warmshowers.org.

## Why?

I love warmshowers.org, but I feel the technical choices made during development were made out of convenience, not because they were the right choices.

I would love to see more contributions to warmshowers.org, but was frustrated myself with having to learn out-dated frameworks, having very little documentation and pretty much nothing in the way of quality assurance.

## How?

 - PHP7 backend (which is pretty much only an API)
 - TypeScript/JavaScript frontend (all website related stuff, templating etc.)

## Features

 - [x] a user has a username, email, address, phone number, latitude and longitude  and password
 - [x] an address consists of a city, zip code, country, street and house number
 - [x] a user can find other users by username, name, email and city
 - [ ] a user can write messages to other users
 - [ ] a user can write a request to other users
 - [ ] a user has a profile
 - [ ] a user can reply to a message
 - [ ] a new user has to sign up

## Design Decisions

#### Immutability

All value objects have to be immutable. If a setter or `add` method is required, it shall return a new instance.

#### `__toString()` and `toString()` on value objects

All value objects have to implement `__toString()` and `toString()`. The implementation of `__toString()` shall call `toString()`.

#### Exposing scalar values on value objects

Value objects which wrap a scalar value (e.g. `string` as the internal representation of `Username`) shall expose (i.e. only if necessary) them using a `toX()` method (e.g. `toString()`, `toInt()`, ...).

#### Type hints

Using type hints for return values and parameters is mandatory.

#### Git commit messages

Messages have to meet the following requirements:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

## Code Quality

 - Line Coverage has to be at least 95%, but usually there shouldn't be any reason to drop below 100%
 - All tests have to add `@covers` and `@uses` annotations to the test class (not the methods)
 - Code has to pass PSR-2 style guidelines (see `style` task in the [Makefile](Makefile))
